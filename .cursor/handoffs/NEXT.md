# NEXT — 2026-11-11 (kitchen plate drawing, round 1 → 2)

## Goal
The block layout is final (round 10). Draw the kitchen in the plate style, then use the drawing to help pick the mark.

## Map
```
style ✅ → colours ✅ → kitchen layout ✅ (round 10) → plate drawing ⏳ (Plate II v2: aligned colour, button lift, scaling) → mark → brand sheet → Task issues → build
```

## Prompt for the next agent
> Kitchen plate drawing, round 2. Read `.cursor/handoffs/NEXT.md`, the `kitchen-layout` and `visual-direction` memories first. The block layout is final; don't change it.
>
> Plate II (https://claude.ai/artifact/Da1GrHKYarXotyj8HwpUpZ, version 2) draws the final layout in the plate style: developer/home cook toggle, a browser-width slider, three window sizes, the open box at its minimum lid height with the A–I / J–Q / R–Z tabs, and three crops at mark size. Start from its source (`Artifact` read, `path: index.html`).
>
> Ari's Plate II answers so far: colour always sits inside its ink line (no off-register colour anywhere, no snapping); things that open lift like a pressable button on hover and press flat; the kitchen scales with the window between a min (80% at 960 px) and a max (140% at 1680 px), cropping the sides below and extending cabinets/counter above. The yellow "paid plan" tags stay for now (not sure about them). The three mark crops (eclair, box, notebook) are liked but none is enough alone. Ask what else to change in the drawing, then move to the mark using `.cursor/handoffs/archive/NEXT-2026-11-09-mark.md`, perhaps combining the crops.

## The layout now (final)
- **Wall:** one board in the middle: whiteboard on the left ("next up", pinned plus automatic, marker font), cork ideas on the right. Lowered to just above the recipe box, with a small gap (round 9 A). The wall above the board stays plain, which leaves room for anniversary equipment or a shelf later. No window, no oven, no title or name
- **Counter, middle:** the Lab notebook on a cookbook stand on the whiteboard's side, tall enough to overlap the board's bottom edge. A half-eaten eclair on a plate in the middle (seasonal flowers maybe later). The recipe box on the cork's side. All three sit close together
- **Side rule:** the Lab is always on the whiteboard's side and the box on the cork's side. The Lab need not be right under the whiteboard
- **Under the counter:** two-tier open shelf (cookbooks above, references below), one drawn book per real one, a cabinet each side. It starts short with one book lying down per tier, and the cabinets narrow as it fills
- **Width:** the whole kitchen scales with the window between a minimum (80%, at 960 px) and a maximum (140%, at 1680 px). Below the minimum the sides crop until the phone layout; above the maximum only the cabinets and counter fill the extra width. No plate border
- **Clickable things:** colour sits inside the ink line; on hover the object lifts like a button on a hard printed shadow, and pressing pushes it flat
- **Top:** find-or-jot bar centred at the top, Account top right. Phone: stacked layout, jot button bottom right
- **Recipe box closed:** "Recipes" in a brass label holder. Click opens it to fill most of the screen over the dimmed kitchen
- **Recipe box open:** the card rests on a ledge in the lid; the lid is empty until a card is picked. The box body is short, sized for three tab rows. The lid grows with the recipe from a minimum (round 9 height, about 45% of the screen) to a limit (about 55%), then the card scrolls. Later: a full-screen card view
- **Tabs:** A–I front, J–Q middle, R–Z back; R–Z lined up with A–I, J–Q centred in the gaps; nine R–Z tabs, no XYZ (drawn in round 10)
- **Roles:** one kitchen for everyone; nothing hidden, nothing moves on upgrade. Paid things (Lab, cork ideas, cookbooks tier) carry a "paid plan" label and open read-only with sample data for cooks and guests. Cooks get the box, whiteboard and references. Guests: decision 002 as it is (starter recipes, up to 5 cards of their own)
- **Equipment:** anniversary equipment later (1 month, 6 months, 1 year, yearly; pick one of three). No pegboard at first

## Still open
- Equipment spots: follow the visible edges, or a fixed distance from the middle
- Whether `design/kitchen-starter/` (20 MB PSD) gets committed (still local)

## Rules to keep
- Plain blocks first; Ari wants to see layouts before any detail. Only the recipe box gets a closer drawing
- Plate style later: ink line, flat colour, halftone, hatching; colour under the line; brand colours from memory `visual-direction`
- Proof locally (Playwright from `frontend/node_modules`, screenshot once), then publish as an artifact
- No code changes until the layout and the mark are settled and Task issues exist

## Files to open first
- Memory: `kitchen-layout.md` and `visual-direction.md`
- `docs/PRD.md` section 2 (personas), `docs/decisions/002-guest-mode.md`, `docs/decisions/004-kitchen-home.md`
- `recipes/recipeboxdisplay.png` (lid with ledge), `recipes/recipeboxdisplay3.png` (preferred look), `recipes/orthisrecipebox.png` (A–Z tabs)
- `.cursor/session_log.mdc`, top entry
